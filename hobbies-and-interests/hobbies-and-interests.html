                <p>
                    My journey into the world of aquascaping began during the Covid pandemic. I have always had
                    a deep love for fishes, observing my father keeping them as pets since I was a child.
                    My father, an avid fish enthusiast himself, taught me the fundamentals of fish care / fish keeping.
                    Observing him nurture fishes instilled me a profound appreciation for animals.
                    <br><br>
                    One day, while browsing for videos at Youtube, I stumbled upon a mesmerizing, relaxing, and cinematic
                    aquascaping video. It captivated me, and inspired me to further explore on this hobby. After conducting
                    extensive research, I embarked on my aquascaping journey, starting with small tanks and gradually
                    progressing to the large, lush aquarium that you can see in the picture on the left.
                    I mainly focus on low-tech fresh water tank set up.
                    <br><br>
                    Aquascaping, which is essentially the craft of aesthetically gardening underwater. This hobby has
                    taught me invaluable lessons in planning and patience. Establishing a balanced nitrogen cycle in
                    the tank's environment takes time, and it is crucial to ensure it is safe before introducing fish.
                    This meticulous process has not only honed my skills but also provided a therapeutic escape.
                    Watching the fish swim gracefully, especially on rainy days, and observing the gradual growth of
                    plants transforming the tank into a verdant oasis, brings me immense joy and tranquility.
                    <br><br>
                    Aquascaping has become more than just a hobby for me; it is a source of relaxation and fulfillment.
                    It combines my love for animals and nature, allowing me to create and maintain
                    a beautiful underwater world.

                    Look at how much my plants have grown! This transformation showcases the hard work, commitment,
                    and patience that aquascaping demands. The top photo was taken on September 27, 2021, and
                    the one below was taken on April 7, 2022.
                    <br><br> Over these months, I've carefully nurtured and
                    maintained the tank, ensuring a balanced environment for the plants to thrive. This transformation
                    is a testament to the rewarding nature of aquascaping, as it allows you to witness the beauty of
                    gradual growth and the fruition of your efforts.
