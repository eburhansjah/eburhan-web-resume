                        Hi, my name is Ellen Burhansjah, and I am a full-time Master's student at Boston University
                        College of Engineering. <br>
                        I am pursuing a degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering with a
                        specialization in Data Analytics. <br> <br>
                    </p>
                    <p>My career path has been diverse. I completed my undergraduate studies in Biochemistry,
                        and my journey into Electrical and Computer Engineering was driven by my undergraduate
                        research experience. I worked in both experimental and computational research and discovered
                        my passion for computational research. It was a Big Data research project on proteins, where
                        I coded in Python and Bash to study the local environment of acetylation sites. <br> <br>

                        After graduation, I aim to pursue careers in data science,
                        data analytics, software engineering, or web application development.
                        I am excited to apply my analytical and technical skills to solve real-world problems. <br> <br>

                        Welcome to my page! I am delighted to have you visit my online resume. Explore my background,
                        experiences, and projects. <br>
                        Feel free to contact me for career opportunities, collaborations or just a chat!
